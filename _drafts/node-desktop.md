I recently found out about node-webkit. A project intended to allow developers to write cross-platform desktop apps by combining
webkit and node.js. As a node developer this sounded too good to be true so I set about writing a simple desktop application as a
proof of concept. I decided to start with an image viewer so I could test the file io and the ui.
