##What is a Isomorphic JavaScript App?

Isomorphic JavaScript apps are applications, written in JavaScript that can run on either the client-side or the server-side.
The backend and frontend share the same code. It became possible with the introduction of Node. 

##React

One of the great design decisions made by the team who created React was to abtract away the DOM. What this means is that you don't need the DOM to exist to make use of the technology. This means that React views can be rendered on the server, on the client, anywhere. You can now even [use React to build native web applications]() Also it's being used by Facebook and Instagram unlike other frameworks (not mentioning any names Angular)

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
string renderToString(ReactElement element)
</pre>
